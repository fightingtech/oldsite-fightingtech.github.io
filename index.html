            <h1>Our Vision</h1>
            <h2>Fighting a ghost</h2>
            <p>Imagine that you have a boxer in one ring and another boxer in a separate ring. They are moving and boxing and through the marvel of modern technology, they are actually seeing each other as though they are in the same ring, which, of course, they're not. At least not in the real world - but in the virtual space they are.</p>
            <p>The boxers are wearing suits that track their bodies and translate their movements into digital animations in real time. By wearing specialized goggles, they can see this as though it was real. This leads them to be facing each other in the ring, eye to eye, as though in a real sparring session.</p>
            <p>But there is a huge difference: they can never really hit each other. A hit is registered in the digital world, but in the physical world they might as well be shadow-boxing.</p>
            <p>This is full contact sparring... without the injuries.
            <h2>This is only the beginning</h2>
            <p>The use of our applications ranges from general entertainment where friends from all over the world will be able to face each other in an intense - but completely safe - virtual boxing fight, to features such as being a high end striking coach, improving the skills and techniques of boxers and fighters throughout the world.</p>
